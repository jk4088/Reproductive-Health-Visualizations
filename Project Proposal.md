## QMSS Data Visualization -- Spring 2018 Final Project Proposal 

Team members: Sophie Beiers, Joo Kim,  Dana Kraushar, Nicole Smith

### Topic: Female Sexual Health 
We are going to focus in on one area of female sexual health; either the #metoo movement (and rape kits/incidence of sexual assault), abortion rates and abortion availability (and maternal/child mortality rates in certain states with strict abortion laws), or access to birth control across the U.S.


### Potential Data Sources 

#### Abortion data:

+ [List of abortion clinics](https://www.safeplaceproject.com/list-of-providers)
	- This is what The Pudding used, but it hasnâ€™t been updated since April 2017.
	- It has addresses for each clinic as well as state restrictions.
	- Use scraper to get data
	
+ [Guttmacher Institute data on abortion rates and clinics by state](https://data.guttmacher.org/states)
	- NGO collects comprehensive data on abortions in each state, including variables like "percentage of women living in a county without a clinic"
	- most recent data is from 2014
	- in .csv format

+ [State data on number of abortions](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm)
	- Voluntary reporting
	- Hasn't been updated since 2014
 
#### Sexual violence/assault data:

+ [Survey data](https://www.bjs.gov/developer/ncvs/index.cfm) not necessarily reported crimes

+ [Crimes reported](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6166) 	
	- Includes previous years that date back to 1993)
	- Table 2: # of rape/sexual assault & domestic violence 
	- Table 5: % of victimizations reported to police for rape/sexual assault 
	- Table 6: Rate of rape/sexual assault/domestic violence reported and not reported to police
	- Table 10: # of victims for rape/sexual assault/domestic violence

+ [Backlogged rape kits:](http://endthebacklog.org/backlog/where-backlog-exists-and-whats-happening-end-it)
	- Missing some states
	- Cross-sectional only

#### Birth control data:

+ YRBS -- survey data from the CDC (only for high school students) -- Nicole has access to national, state, and large-urban area data from her RAship (& permission to use)

+ Guttmacher (ages 14 - 50) but requires more cleaning than the YRBS

+ The Pill Club data (pending permission from the organization) 

### Visualization possibilities:
+ Map of US -- chloropleth showing which states have strict abortion laws and their maternal mortality rates. Could potentially make this over time, too.

+ Arrow / lollipop charts showing change in abortion or sexual assault rates over time, highlighting interesting state cases

+ Pyramid chart relating abortion rate to birth or infant/maternal mortality rates

+ Text Analysis -- #MeToo (using Twitter API and other scrapers)
