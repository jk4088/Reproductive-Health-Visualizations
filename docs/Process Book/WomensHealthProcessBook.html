After scraping data from </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.safeplaceproject.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1525485067028000">The Safe Place Project</a></span><span>, Nicole used a Google API key to find the longitude and latitude of each clinic in the US. In order to map the clinics as point data, a shapefile of US counties was collected, and centroids were calculated using QGIS software. Next, she used the &ldquo;dist&rdquo; function in the geosphere package to calculate the distance between the centroids and the clinics, then saved the minimum distance between centroids and clinics. Because of the nature of working with country data, it appears that some of the counties that visually look like they would be within a certain driving distance to a clinic are not shaded as such because the location of the centroid is further away. The size of a county is not uniform across states, which makes it appear that there are fewer counties in the Midwest that have access to abortion clinics. While this may be true politically, it is important to recognize that some lack of access can be attributable to differences in distance. This might explain why the Pudding used honeycombs to represent space in the US rather than county data. Although I received some suggestions to plot the point data to better illustrate the distance between centroids, the map is too difficult to read when counties are small, and it skews the points of clinics. </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 134.65px; height: 163.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 134.65px; height: 163.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 242.50px; height: 162.01px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 242.50px; height: 162.01px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because of some feedback about confusing the colors, I added some additional comments to the shiny app to explain how to interpret the graph. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After spending some time recoding/cleaning the data, we realized that we were losing some of the intricacies of the abortion data and decided to implement a data table to show how state differ. After some suggestions from classmates, Nicole cleaned up the data table to include things like &ldquo;Not reported&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; instead of Xs. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole also scraped the data from pro choice and pro life organizational websites. To do this, she looked at the &ldquo;About,&rdquo; &ldquo;Resources,&rdquo; and &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo; sections of websites in an attempt to obtain similar information from both sides of the arguments. As mentioned in the presentation, a lot of the pro life organizations had stories, which may explain the lower frequencies of words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although similar to the wordcloud that Joo used for text analysis, Nicole made a pyramid plot that displays the top 25 words used by the two different organizations. In order to make the best use of the interactivity of shiny, Nicole chose to calculate the top 25 words for each organization plotted against the other in order to show how the words differ. However, it seems that the wordcloud and pyramid plot are representing the same information, and it may be better to condense this information into one visualization. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Dana </span><span>created the time series plot of abortions since Roe v.

The abortion rate dipped below Roe levels for the first time in 2014, but we did not comfortable combining disparate datasets that had different measurements of abortion in the intervening years. The absence of pre-1973 data, which would have been useful for a before-and-after comparison, speaks to data limitations inherent to this topic: abortions certainly occurred prior, but without the legal legitimacy afforded by Roe, the information was not systematically collected in every state. It also would have been interesting to compare fluxuations in abortion rates across states and over time, particularly to look for any trends in policies affecting outcomes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 252.69px; height: 155.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 252.69px; height: 155.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dana was also responsible for the Leaflet choropleth map of abortion rates across the different states, with a hover tooltip showing that state&rsquo;s abortion rate, when abortion access is restricted (if at all), and whether a licensed physician is required to perform abortions.

Ideally, it would have been possible to include a checkboxGroupInput option allowing the user to toggle between the different restrictions, but after much research, there did not seem to be a way to add those features to filter data in a choropleth map in Shiny. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 289.42px; height: 194.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 289.42px; height: 194.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Joo:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Waffle chart &ndash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Joo created waffle charts to visualize abortion rates across race. The Guttmacher Institute provides data on the number of abortions per one-thousand Black, Hispanic, White, and other women, although this statistic is available for only 30 states.

They demonstrate subtle yet clear differences. On one hand, language employed by pro-choice supporters include words such as &ldquo;law&rdquo; and &ldquo;states&rdquo; that we presume are utilized to explain federal and state laws on abortion and how they may affect women&rsquo;s getting an abortion should they desire the procedure. On the other hand, pro-life supporters tend to invoke emotion by using words like &ldquo;fetus&rdquo; and &ldquo;baby&rdquo;, likely in an attempt to propagate the notion that life begins at conception and persuade women to seek other options. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
